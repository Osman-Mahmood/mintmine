                  (13) Why the donations and the rewards are distributed manuallly?

                </Accordion.Header>
                <Accordion.Body> <p>For several reasons.

                  <p>In regards of the donations for public goods funding, here are some of the considerations for sending the donations manually:
                  </p>
                  <p>-  What if the recipient of donations stops their previous activity (perhaps being that the reason u369 was donating in the first place)?
                  </p>
                  <p>- What if that wallet gets compromised / hacked?
                  </p>
                  <p>- What if the recipient stops their previous activity (perhaps being that the reason u369 was donating in the first place)?
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst other reasons, as the ones explained above, made us distribute donations manually.
                  </p>
                  <p>In regards of distributing rewards to end-users manually: When testing, we idientified an exploit that can be carried on by end-users with bad intent.
                  </p>
                  <p>Example: The prize-pool is $10,000 -- an end-user with $1,000 to protect and bad intent could do the protection of their $1,000 in sevaral txs (for ex 100 Tx of $10) just for the purpose of having 100 more chances to win the $10,000 than if just they would send the $1,000 in on Tx.
                  </p>
                  <p>Distributing the funds to the randomly selected winners manually, helps to avoid the exploit as funds are failry distributed according to the amount of funds the end-user involved. No more and no less is rewarded but only what can be matematically-proven as fair.
                  </p>

                    <li>What is a crypto wallet?</li>
                    <p>A crypto wallet is an interface that allows you to manage your cryptographic tokens. A wallet helps to manage, send, and receive crypto tokens on the blockchain.</p>
                    <p> Your wallet is a combination of a public and a private cryptographic key that are used together to access your crypto.
                    </p>
                    <p>A wallet can have as many public addresses as you desire.
                    </p>
                    <li>What  is a public address?
                    </li>
                    <p>A public address is the unique string of characters that you use to receive funds.
                    </p>
                    <li>What is a network/blockchain?</li>
                    <p>A blockchain is distributed ledger, often public and decentralized, consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.

                    </p>
                    <li>What are public goods?</li>
                    <p>In economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good), is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. End-users cannot be denied from accessing public goods. Also, the use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others. Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person.</p>
                    <li>Recommended best security practice:</li>
                    <p>Not mandatory, but as a best security precaution, we advise to:
                    </p>
                    <p>(A) When the Concealed Master Key is presented without being revelaed in plain text >> turn the Wi-Fi/internet off.
                    </p>
                    <p>(B) Copy the Concealed Master Key u369 provides (you -as anybody else- will not be able to see it on the interface).
                    </p>
                    <p>(C) With the Wi-Fi or any internet connection OFF for a moment. Paste the Concealed Master Key in a ephemeral-note* on your device. (Ephemeral-note because you should delete that note as per a further step indication).</p>
                    <p>(D) To make sure your Concealed Master Key is saved offline and someplace safe: Momentarily, and without misspelling, write down in a piece of paper your Concealed Master Key that you pasted in the ephemeral-note (more on this at the end).</p>
                    <p>
(E) After you confirmed that the 32 characters are correct and match >> please delete the Concealed Master Key from the ephemeral-note on your device.
                    </p>
                    <p>(F) Turn on the Wi-Fi.</p>
                    <p>(G) Set and confirm password by confirming the Tx in your wallet.</p>
                    <p>(H) Before sending any funds to the contract, try "Forgot password" >> turn-off the Wi-Fi again >> input the Concealed Master Key to set new password >> after the Concealed Master Key has been input in the respective field >> turn on the Wi-Fi >> if the "Reset password" segment displays, that means your Concealed Master Key is correct!
                    </p>
                    <p>If you lose your password, only the Concealed Master Key can be used to reset the password; otherwise you will not be able to interact with the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
(I) In point 4 we mentioned: "Momentarily, and without misspelling, write down in a piece of paper the Master Private Key" as a convenient way to have your Master Private Key written down offline; however, the best recommendation to store your Master Key (and your wallet's private keys as well) >> better than a piece of paper is a solid, stainless, acid-resistant, shockproof, and fireproof metal.</p>

                  <p>The prize pool is a u369 address that programmatically receives 30% of all the collected benefaction-fees. The funds inside this address are used to reward one u369 end-user every 369 hours (if any address(es) would have interacted with the smart contract.</p>

                  (21) How does the u369 system selects the winner to receive funds from the prize-pool?

                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>The function get_currentWinner() is used in the smart contract. This is the logic implemented:</p>
                  <p>(A) The system checks how many addresses protected ETH or native ERC20 tokens and minted uTokens within a period from 0 to 369 hours.</p>
                  <p>(B) At the end of the 369 hours, if no address interacted with the contract, the system returns a zero result, otherwise the system randomly selects one winner-address from all the addresses that interacted with the contract.
                  </p>
                  <p> To implement this the u369 system uses the following formula: </p>
                  <p>"uint randomNumber = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(previousTimePeriod, deployTime))) % depositorsLength;"</p>
                  <p>In simple words, the procedure is defined in the following steps:</p>
                  <p>1. A keccak hash (hashing algorithm) is applied on the previous time period and contract deploy time.</p>
                  <p>2. Hash is converted to integer value.</p>
                  <p>3. A modulus operation performs on the converted integer and number of addresses in the last time period.</p>
                  <p>The this question "Why the donations and the rewards are distributed manually?" would be in #15 and so on and so forth.</p>

                  (23) Recommended best security practice
                </Accordion.Header>
                <Accordion.Body>
                  <p>Not mandatory, but as a best security precaution, we advise to:</p>
                  <p>(A) When u369 presents the Concealed Master Key: turn the Wi-Fi/internet off.
                  </p>
                  <p>(B) Copy the Master Key u369 provides (for security reasons it is presented encrypted/concealed and only once). And you own it.
                  </p>
                  <p> (C) With the Wi-Fi or any internet connection OFF for a moment. Paste the Concealed Master Key in a ephemeral-note* on your device. Important: Ephemeral-note because you should delete that note from your device after the Master Key is saved offline as per further indication in last step (I). </p>
                  <p>(D) To make sure your Concealed Master Key is saved offline and someplace safe: Momentarily, and without misspelling, write down in a piece of paper your Concealed Master Key that you pasted in the ephemeral-note (more on this in step (I) at the end).
                  </p>
                  <p>(E) After you confirmed that the 32 characters are correct and match >> please delete the Concealed Master Key from the ephemeral-note on your device.</p>
                  <p>(F) Turn on the Wi-Fi.</p>
                  <p>(G) Set and confirm password by confirming the Tx in your wallet.</p>
                  <p>(H) Before sending any funds to the u369 contract, try/click "Forgot password" >> turn-off the Wi-Fi again >> input/paste the Concealed Master Key to set new password >> after the Concealed Master Key is in the respective field >> turn on the Wi-Fi >> if the "Reset password" segment displays ("New password" -- "Confirm Password") that means your Concealed Master Key is correct and you have sovereign over your money.</p>
                  <p>If you lose your password, only the Concealed Master Key can be used to reset the password; otherwise you will not be able to interact with u369 smart contract.</p>
                  <p>(I) In point D is mentioned: "Momentarily, and without misspelling, write down in a piece of paper the Master Private Key" as a convenient way to have your Master Private Key written down offline; however, the best recommendation to store your Master Private Key (and your wallet's private keys as well) >> better than a piece of paper is a solid, stainless, acid-resistant, shockproof, and fireproof metal.</p>
