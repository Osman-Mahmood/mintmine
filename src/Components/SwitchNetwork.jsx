      <p>The u369 smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Avalanche Networks, Metis and Base.</p>
   <p>To protect and/or transfer your tokens on a different network, you must change the network first.</p>
   1) Select the network icon in the upper right hand of the screen (we will display a screenshot of the website there under every point)
  <p>2) Select the network you would like to use</p>
  <p>3) You should see the new network name. Now, you are ready to protect -mint unhackable tokens (uTokens)- transfer and claim your unhackable tokens (uTokens) over that network!</p>
