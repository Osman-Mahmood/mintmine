 <h5>What are public goods?</h5>
 <p>In economics, a public good (also referred to as a social good or collective good)[1] is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Public goods are free to use and the end-users cannot be denied from accessing them. </p>
 <p>Also, the use by one person neither prevents access of other people nor does it reduce availability to others. Therefore, the good can be used simultaneously by more than one person.</p>
