                Important Note: The Master Key provided in the beginning is the unique authentication code to reset/change the password you created. PLEASE DO NOT LOSE YOUR MASTER KEY, otherwise, if you ever lose the password you created >> your funds will be stuck forever in the smart contract as no one can recover that password nor the Master Key for you.

Not mandatory, but a recommended security best practice:
<br />
• Same as you’re supposed to do with your Private Keys when you keep high amount of value in cryptographic assets >> store your Master Key offline; (2) if possible use a password manager to store the password created to interact with u369.eth

• Once you have copied your Master Key: (A) turn off your internet connection, (B) temporarily, paste your Master Key on a note in your device, (C) momentarily, write the Master Key in a piece of paper (i.e., offline) –without any misspelling and save it someplace safe, (D) double check that all is a match, (E) once confirmed that all matches 100%, and is written offline >> delete the Master Key from the note on your device, turn on your internet connection again and go back to u369.eth to continue to set your password.

• You can always test that your Master Key works as intended even before depositing any funds into the smart contract. (1) Just click the protect or transfer button and set password by signing an on-chain Tx; (2) click on forgot password and when the segment to input your Master Key shows up >> input your Master Key >> if the "change password" flow shows up, that means your Master key is working as intended. You can then feel free and 100% confident to interact with the u369.eth smart contract without the possibility of getting hacked by a malicious actor and without the distress of having the funds locked indefinitely inside the smart contract.

• To store your Master key (and your private keys as well) >> better than a piece of paper is a solid, stainless, acid-resistant, shockproof, and fireproof metal.
