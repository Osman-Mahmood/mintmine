        <p>A crypto wallet is an interface that allows you to manage your cryptographic tokens. With a wallet you can store, send, and receive crypto tokens on the blockchain.</p>

<p>Your wallet is a combination of a public and a private cryptographic key that are used together to access your crypto.</p> 

 <p>The public address of your wallet is used to receive funds, and a wallet can have as many public addresses as you desire. </p>
